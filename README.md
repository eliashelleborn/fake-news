It contains the following features:

## Installation

3. Open http://localhost:8888/fake-news/public

NOTE
  >If you decide to rename the project folder you also have to switch out the "BASE_URL" in the ".env" file. Just switch out the "/fake-news" part with the new name.
  
  >The website will only work when served with Apache due to the use of .htaccess files
